# ExamTime

ExamTime Web App

    ExamTime is a web application designed and developed entirely by me with the goal of helping students access essential study materials in a streamlined and efficient manner. This project stems from my own idea of simplifying the process for students to find and refer to PDFs related to our college syllabus.
    The current implementation of ExamTime uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface and navigation. It is an ongoing project, where I plan to add more features and transition it into a full-stack application in the future.

Features of the ExamTime Web App

Navigation and Layout:
    A top-right navigation bar with options for "Home" and "About" sections.
    A menu icon (hamburger menu) on the top-left, providing quick access to:
      Home
      Subjects
      Data Structures
      Login
      About
      
Front Page Design:
      Displays available regulations (e.g., 20 and 23) for students to choose from.
Includes programming language references like Python, C, and Java for quick access to related materials.

Dynamic Content Loading:
    Upon selecting a regulation, users are directed to a page displaying:
        Year options: 1st, 2nd, 3rd year, etc.
        Branches: Options for various engineering or academic streams.
    After selecting a branch, a list of subjects is displayed, each represented with a cover photo for easy identification.
    Clicking on a subject opens a page with a list of five units, each unit containing downloadable PDFs.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
